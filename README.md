# 🏄🏻‍♂️ David Michael Mackey

As a web developer, who specializes in front-end & back-end, I believe in designing a cleaner, more accessible world, where user-interfaces are mediums between human & machine that foster intelligent, intuitive, and delightful interactions.
<br>
Together, through a collective effort, we can bridge the intersection of simplicity & function to craft an inspiring, compelling, and authentic brand narrative.
<br>
Let's design a world that's thoughtful, considered, and aesthetically pleasing.
